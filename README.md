## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Martel+Sans) for styling

### What I learned

In this project, I further developed my skills in HTML and CSS, particularly in using Flexbox for layout and managing hover and focus states for interactive elements. I also gained experience in working with CSS variables for efficient color management and font styling using Google Fonts.

```css
/* Example of using CSS variables */
:root {
    --green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --grey: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    --dark-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    --off-black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
}
```
